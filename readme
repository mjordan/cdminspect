## Usage

There are two steps in generating a report of field values, 1) getting a list of CONTENTdm field 'nicknames' and 2) generating the list of unique values for a specific nickname.

For example, to get a list of the field nicknames for a collection, run this command:

```
./run get_nicknames.plugin alias
```


where 'alias' is the CONTENTdm collection's alias (string identifying a particular collection) without the leading `/`). This will produce a list of fields and their nicknames:

```
./run get_nicknames.plugin vanpunk_1

Field nicknames for Vancouver Punk Rock Collection

Field label => field nickname
=============================
Title => title
Bands => bands
Poster Artist => poster
Description => descri
Date => date
Display date => displa
Type => type
Format => format

Producer or Presenter => produc
Language => langua
Venue => venue
Dimensions (inches) => dimens
Poster text => postea
Rights => rights

Subjects => subjec
Place => place
Full text => full
Archival file => fullrs
OCLC number => dmoclcno
Date created => dmcreated
Date modified => dmmodified
CONTENTdm number => dmrecord
CONTENTdm file name => find
```

Then, to generate the list of unique values in a field, run the following command

```
./run get_field_values.plugin alias nickname email@address.com
```

Running this command to get a list of all the unique values from the 'bands' field ('bands' is the nickname, to the right of the human-readable field name 'Bands') for the Vancouver Punk Rock Collection, and emailing the list to mjordan@sfu.ca,  would look like this:

```
./run get_field_values.plugin vanpunk_1 bands mjordan@sfu.ca
```

A sample of the output from this particular command is:

```
The Diefenbakers
The Dijits
The Dils
The Dinnettes
The Dishrags
The Dragons
The Droogs
Thee Atoms
The Eddy Dutchman Jazz Trio
The Edsells
The Enemy
The Enigmas
The Escorts
The Evaporators
The Exploited
The Explosions
The Fabulous Wallies
The Fabulous Wallys
The Fartz
The Fastbacks
The Feederz
```
Ah ha! Looks like using this tool has paid off: the 'Bands' field contains two versions of 'The Fabulous Wallies.'

## Background

This tool was cobbled together in support of Simon Fraser University (SFU) Library's migration from CONTENTdm to Islandora. It's not written using modern PHP best practices since it was developed to meet a specific need.

## Future

Once SFU has migrated away from CONTENTdm, its staff won't have any use for this utility... but that's not to say that it should be abandoned. Perhaps some other CONTENTdm site will take it on and make it more useful.
